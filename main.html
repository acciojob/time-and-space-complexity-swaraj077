	<h1>Time & Space Complexity</h1>
	
	<p id = Time_Complexity>
		Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. <br>
		It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. <br>
		Time complexity can make the program behave in required optimal conditions, and by doing so, it makes us efficient programmers.
	</p>

	<p id = "Space_Complexity">
		The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. <br>
		Space Complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. <br>
		For example, if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space, then Auxiliary Space would be a better criterion than Space Complexity. <br> 
		Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space.
